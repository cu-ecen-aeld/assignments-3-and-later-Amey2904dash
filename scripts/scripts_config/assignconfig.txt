# When you create a new assignment you will typically want to set STARTS_WITH_PREV_ASSIGN=true, NUMBER_CURRENT to the current assignment
# and NUMBER_PREV to the previous assignment.  This will setup pull requests between the previous assignment and current assignment

NUMBER_PREV=2

# Used when starts_with_prev_assign is true (and used to find each student's repository related to the previous assignment)
